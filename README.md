- **Course Level**: Undergraduate (half-semester introductory course):contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **Instructors**: Dr. Ana Bell, Prof. Eric Grimson, Prof. John Guttag:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- **Primary Textbook**:  
  *Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python*, by John Guttag (MIT Press, 2016):contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- **Core Topics Covered**:  
  - Fundamental Python constructs (loops, conditionals, strings)  
  - Approximations & bisection search, recursion, dictionaries  
  - Functions, abstraction, decomposition  
  - Data structures (lists, tuples), mutability & aliasing  
  - Debugging, testing, exceptions, assertions  
  - Object-oriented programming (classes, inheritance)  
  - Algorithm efficiency, searching & sorting:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

##  Repository Contents

Each `psetX/` folder corresponds to a problem set from the course:
- **pset0** – Initial setup tasks and environment configuration
- **pset1–pset5** – Increasingly complex programming assignments, touching on control flow, algorithms, classes, and data handling

Included formats:
- `.py` — Python solution files
- `README.md` (in each problem set) — Brief description of objectives and my approach
- `.pdf` or ancillary files, where available, for reference and context

##  Skills Demonstrated

- Practical coding in Python 3.5 (per course specification):contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- Structured problem-solving and algorithmic thinking  
- Writing clean, readable, and tested code  
- Debugging and iterative development  
- Understanding of object-oriented concepts and recursion  
- Implementation of efficient search and sorting techniques

##  Usage & Viewing

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/pjad6191/MIT-OCW-6.100A-Intro-to-CS-in-Python

2. Navigate into the problem set directory:
   cd psetX
3. Review the Python scripts, and run them using Python 3:
   python3 solution.py

4. Each folder includes its own README to guide you through the problem and solution details.

##  Why This Matters

- Demonstrates **self-directed learning** using advanced MIT-level course materials  
- Shows mastery of **core computer science concepts** taught in an introductory CS curriculum  
- Provides tangible evidence of coding ability and project organization for recruiters, grad schools, or collaborators
