##  Repository Contents

Each `psetX/` folder corresponds to a problem set from the course:
- **pset0** – Initial setup tasks and environment configuration
- **pset1–pset5** – Increasingly complex programming assignments, touching on control flow, algorithms, classes, and data handling

Included formats:
- `.py` — Python solution files
- `README.md` (in each problem set) — Brief description of objectives and my approach
- `.pdf` or ancillary files, where available, for reference and context

- Structured problem-solving and algorithmic thinking  
- Writing clean, readable, and tested code  
- Debugging and iterative development  
- Understanding of object-oriented concepts and recursion
