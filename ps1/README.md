## üìù Original Assignment Summary

**Part A: House Hunting**  

Taking on the view of someone who has graduated from MIT and moved to the San Francisco Bay area, the goal is to save up enough to buy a house. Considering the high cost of housing, it will be necessary to save for several year to afford the down payment. Part A determines how long it will take to say enough money to make the down payment given the following assumptions:

1. Call the cost of your dream home total_cost.
2. Call the portion of the cost needed for a down payment portion_down_payment. For
simplicity, assume that portion_down_payment = 0.25 (25%).
3. Call the amount that you have saved thus far current_savings. You start with a current
savings of $0. 
4. Assume that you invest your current savings wisely, with an annual return of r (in other words,
at the end of each month, you receive an additional current_savings*r/12 funds to put into
your savings ‚Äì the 12 is because r is an annual rate). Assume that your investments earn a 
return of r = 0.04 (4%).
5. Assume your annual salary is annual_salary.
6. Assume you are going to dedicate a certain amount of your salary each month to saving for 
the down payment. Call that portion_saved. This variable should be in decimal form (i.e. 0.1
for 10%). 
7. At the end of each month, your savings will be increased by the return on your investment,
plus a percentage of your monthly salary (annual salary / 12).

Hints     
To help you get started, here is a rough outline of the stages you should probably follow in writing your 
code:   
‚óè Retrieve user input. Look at input() if you need help with getting user input. For this problem set, 
you can assume that users will enter valid input (e.g. they won‚Äôt enter a string when you expect 
an int)   
‚óè Initialize some state variables. You should decide what information you need.  Be careful about 
values that represent annual amounts and those that represent monthly amounts. 
  
Try different inputs and see how long it takes to save for a down payment.  Please make your 
program print results in the format shown in the test cases below.    

Test Case 1   
>>>   
Enter your annual salary: 120000   
Enter the percent of your salary to save, as a decimal: .10   
Enter the cost of your dream home: 1000000   
Number of months: 183  

**Part B: Saving, With a Raise**  

In the section we take into account that the user has a semi-annual raise. Like before, we will write a program to calculate how many months it will take to save up enough money for a down payment. Again we will assume that investments earn a return of r‚Äã = 0.04 (or 4%) and the required down payment percentage is 0.25 (or 25%)

Additions to the code:
1. Have the user input a semi-annual salary raise semi_annual_raise‚Äã (as a decimal percentage)
2. After the 6th month, increase your salary by that percentage.  Do the same after the 12

Hints   
To help you get started, here is a rough outline of the stages you should probably follow in writing your 
code:   
‚óè Retrieve user input.     
‚óè Initialize some state variables. You should decide what information you need.  Be sure to be 
careful about values that represent annual amounts and those that represent monthly amounts.   
‚óè Be careful about when you increase your salary ‚Äì this should only happen after the 6th, 12th, 18th 
month, and so on.   

Try different inputs and see how quickly or slowly you can save enough for a down payment.  Please 
make your program print results in the format shown in the test cases below.  

Test Case 1   
>>>    
Enter your starting annual salary: 120000   
Enter the percent of your salary to save, as a decimal: .05   
Enter the cost of your dream home: 500000   
Enter the semi annual raise, as a decimal: .03   
Number of months: 142   
>>>   

**Part C: Finding the Right Amount to Save Away**

In Part B, we had a chance to explore how both the percentage of your salary that you save each month 
and your annual raise affect how long it takes you to save for a down payment.  This is nice, but 
suppose you want to set a particular goal, e.g. to be able to afford the down payment in three years. 
How much should you save each month to achieve this?  In this problem, you are going to write a 
program to answer that question.  To simplify things, assume: 

1. Your semi annual raise is .07 (7%) 
2. Your investments have an annual return of 0.04 (4%)  
3. The down payment is 0.25 (25%) of the cost of the house 
4. The cost of the house that you are saving for is $1M.

We are now going to try to find the best rate of savings to achieve a down payment on a $1M house in 
36 months. Since hitting this exactly is a challenge, we simply want your savings to be within $100 of 
the required down payment. 

In ps1c.py, write a program to calculate the best savings rate, as a function of your starting salary. 
You should use bisection search to help you do this efficiently. You should keep track of the number of 
steps it takes your bisections search to finish. You should be able to reuse some of the code you wrote 
for part B in this problem.  

Because we are searching for a value that is in principle a float, we are going to limit ourselves to two 
decimals of accuracy (i.e., we may want to save at 7.04%  or 0.0704 in decimal ‚Äì but we are not 
going to worry about the difference between 7.041% and 7.039%).  This means we can search for an 
integer between 0 and 10000 (using integer division), and then convert it to a decimal percentage 
(using float division) to use when we are calculating the current_savings after 36 months. By using 
this range, there are only a finite number of numbers that we are searching over, as opposed to the 
infinite number of decimals between 0 and 1. This range will help prevent infinite loops. The reason we 
use 0 to 10000 is to account for two additional decimal places in the range 0% to 100%. The code 
should print out a decimal (e.g. 0.0704 for 7.04%). 

Try different inputs for your starting salary, and see how the percentage you need to save changes to 
reach your desired down payment.  Also keep in mind it may not be possible for to save a down 
payment in a year and a half for some salaries. In this case your function should notify the user that it 
is not possible to save for the down payment in 36 months with a print statement. Please make your 
program print results in the format shown in the test cases below.

Note: There are multiple right ways to implement bisection search/number of steps so your 
results may not perfectly match those of the test case. 

Hints   
‚óè There may be multiple savings rates that yield a savings amount that is within $100 of the 
required down payment on a $1M house. In this case, you can just return any of the possible 
values.   
‚óè Depending on your stopping condition and how you compute a trial value for bisection search, 
your number of steps may vary slightly from the example test cases.   
‚óè Watch out for integer division when calculating if a percentage saved is appropriate and when 
calculating final decimal percentage savings rate.   
‚óè Remember to reset the appropriate variable(s) to their initial values for each iteration of bisection 
search.   

Test Case 1 
>>>  
Enter the starting salary: 150000   
Best savings rate: 0.4411    
Steps in bisection search: 12   
>>>

## ‚úÖ My Approach
Briefly describe how you solved it:
- Step 1: I wrote out a rough step by step guide line of what I wanted each program to accomplish. This helped me visualize the flow and structure. 
- Step 2: Instead of having user inputs, I created variables that I knew the outcome with so that I was able to debug any problems and ensure everythign was working correctly. This allowed me to test each part independently. 
- Step 3: Once my program works with the variables I initiated, I added the user inputs and tried it with different case scenarios to make sure the program handled all types of inputs.
- Step 4: For Part C, I created a bisection search and make sure that it properly calculated the savings rate needed for a down payment within 36 months. I also handled a case for when a salary was not enough to save up a down payment within 36 months.
