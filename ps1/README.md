# Problem Set 1 ‚Äì MIT 6.0001: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python

## üìÑ Assignment Overview  
**Completed:** [DATE]     
**Source:** [MIT OCW ‚Äì Problem Set X](LINK_TO_OCW_PROBLEM)  

This problem set introduces control flow in Python and formulating a computational solution to a problem. It also allows a chance to explore bisection search.  
There will be three problems which will be saved as:
1. ps1a.py
2. ps1b.py
3. ps1c.py

## üìù Original Assignment Summary

**Part A: House Hunting**  

Taking on the view of someone who has graduated from MIT and moved to the San Francisco Bay area, the goal is to save up enough to buy a house. Considering the high cost of housing, it will be necessary to save for several year to afford the down payment. Part A determines how long it will take to say enough money to make the down payment given the following assumptions:

1. Call the cost of your dream home total_cost.
2. Call the portion of the cost needed for a down payment portion_down_payment. For
simplicity, assume that portion_down_payment = 0.25 (25%).
3. Call the amount that you have saved thus far current_savings. You start with a current
savings of $0. 
4. Assume that you invest your current savings wisely, with an annual return of r (in other words,
at the end of each month, you receive an additional current_savings*r/12 funds to put into
your savings ‚Äì the 12 is because r is an annual rate). Assume that your investments earn a 
return of r = 0.04 (4%).
5. Assume your annual salary is annual_salary.
6. Assume you are going to dedicate a certain amount of your salary each month to saving for 
the down payment. Call that portion_saved. This variable should be in decimal form (i.e. 0.1
for 10%). 
7. At the end of each month, your savings will be increased by the return on your investment,
plus a percentage of your monthly salary (annual salary / 12).
